# MoneyManager
Money manager, expense tracker, budget, wallet: expense and income tracker, money, finances app will help you take your budget, money and finances under control and won’t take much time.

This is a new [**React Native**] Money Manager project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

```sh
# Using npm
npm i
cd ./ios pod install
cd ..
npm run ios

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
